The purpose of this repo is to give a voice to those who wanted an independent GitHub, not one owned by any company with any business or agenda outside of serving the open source community. It is a place for such people to collaborate on options, given that GitHub is no longer independent.

If you are not such a person, this place isn't a forum for you.

It is NOT a place to debate the acquisition or the opinions of those opposed to it. It is not a place for you to try to convert people. It is certainly not a place to patronize, troll or otherwise be rude. I will enforce this without hesitation.

Please respect our wishes. You are welcome to make whatever argument you want on [UpEnd's twitter](https://twitter.com/UpEnd_org), if you really need to.
