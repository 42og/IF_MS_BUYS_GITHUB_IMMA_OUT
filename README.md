## How to stop this

**First, star this repo** as a vote to keep GitHub independent.

**Then spread the word** any way you can.

If you have a way with words, please make a pull request to add to this page, or add other pages to turn this into a website. Though I kind of think the repo title speaks for itself. That and thousands of stars next to it.

If you have other ideas to further this cause, please make a pull request or create an Issue.
