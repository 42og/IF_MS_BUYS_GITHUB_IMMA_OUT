## How to stop this

**First, star this repo** as a vote to keep GitHub independent.

**Then spread the word** any way you can. Share, [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fupend%2FIF_MS_BUYS_GITHUB_IMMA_OUT&text=Microsoft%20is%20trying%20to%20buy%20GitHub.%20Tell%20GitHub%20to%20%23resist.%20%23NeverMicrosoft.%20@upend%20the%20web%20oligarchy.) or post a link to this repo.

If you have a way with words, please make a pull request to add to this page, or add other pages to turn this into a website. Though I kind of think the repo title speaks for itself. That and thousands of stars next to it.

If you have other ideas to further this cause, please make a pull request or create an Issue.
